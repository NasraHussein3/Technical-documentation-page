In this project my learning outcomes where:
1. Experimented with debugging techniques to find and fix errors in the code.
2. Practiced effective project organization and file structure.
3. Gained exposure to version control systems (e.g., Git) and learned how to commit changes.
4. Improved my ability to work independently and self-motivate.
